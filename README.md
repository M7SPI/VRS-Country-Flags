Custom country flags for [Virtual Radar Server](https://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk "Virtual Radar Server's Homepage") (a.k.a. VRS). This plug-in replaces the country text name with their respective national flag.

## Prerequisites
- VRS installed and running.
- VRS Custom Content Plugin installed and enabled.

## Instructions
- Clone or download the repo into a directory on the machine where VRS is running. Ensure you do not place the files under the Virtual Radar Server directory, since they could be overwritten on upgrades.
- Configure the VRS Custom Content Plugin as shown below (Change the destination root directory accordingly with your own choice).

- In the Web interface, enable the Country option under the "List" tab ( Works best in the Brazilian Portuguese version).
- Enjoy!

## Acknowledgments
This project was only possible thanks to the invaluable help of many individuals and communities, especially the creator of the VRS, Andrew Whewell, always solicitous in [![his forum](https://img.shields.io/badge/VRS-Forum-blue.svg)](https://forum.virtualradarserver.co.uk/); Andrew Hill, whose [![flights.hillhome.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/flights-hillhome.org-ADD6FF.svg)](http://flights.hillhome.org/) site inspired me deeply; and all of the [![ADS-B Brasil](https://img.shields.io/badge/ADS--B-Brasil-lightgrey.svg)](http://bradsb.com/forum/index.php) community, including Ramon Martins and Jaime Hempke, which together maintain the excellent site [![TrafegoAereo.com](https://img.shields.io/badge/Trafego-Aereo-yellowgreen.svg)](http://trafegoaereo.com/).

Feel free to download and share these files, suggest corrections, or send requests for more country flags, as I'm constantly updating this repository until all countries are available.
